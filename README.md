# UI Developer Exercise

To run the app:

1. npm install
2. npm start

# Notes

- I've kept the UI barebones and not included any account/balance system as the instructions said I could decide how basic/complex I wanted to make it and with the bank holiday time constraints I didn't want to overdo it.

- I chose to to use localStorage for minimal data storage for the orders as I think it's better in case of accidental refresh etc. to keep details

- I chose to use React as this is something I'm familiar with and could work quickly in a short time, if I had more time I'd explore redoing it with web components. I also used regular css.
